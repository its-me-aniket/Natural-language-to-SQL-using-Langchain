SQL_GENERATION_PROMPT = """You are a senior SQL developer.
You are given schema information for the database and must write a single, syntactically correct SQL query (MySQL dialect) that answers the user's request.

Rules:
- Use ONLY tables/columns that appear in the schema below.
- Do not invent tables or columns.
- Output ONLY the SQL (no explanation, no backticks).
- Always alias tables using the first letter of the table name (e.g., users AS u, orders AS o).
- If the question is ambiguous, pick the most reasonable interpretation.
- If the request does not require a query (e.g., "how many tables"), still return SQL that answers it.

Schema:
{table_info}

# Few-shot examples:
Example 1:
Schema:
- users(id, name, email)
- orders(id, user_id, total)

Question: List all users who have placed more than 3 orders.
SQL: SELECT u.id, u.name, u.email
     FROM users AS u
     JOIN orders AS o ON u.id = o.user_id
     GROUP BY u.id
     HAVING COUNT(o.id) > 3;

Example 2:
Schema:
- employees(id, name, department_id, salary)
- departments(id, name)

Question: Show the average salary per department.
SQL: SELECT d.name, AVG(e.salary) AS avg_salary
     FROM employees AS e
     JOIN departments AS d ON e.department_id = d.id
     GROUP BY d.name;

Question:
{input}

-- Return only the SQL query:
"""

FINAL_ANSWER_PROMPT = """You are a helpful data analyst. Given the question, the SQL executed, and the query result, produce a concise, clear answer in plain English.

User question:
{question}

SQL executed:
{query}

Query result (first 20 rows shown as JSON-like):
{result}

Now produce a short explanation (1-5 sentences) summarizing the result and mentioning any notable values, or say "No rows returned" if empty.
